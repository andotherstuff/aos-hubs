# Types of Convenings

This is a non-exhaustive list of convenings and how we think about what they're for.

- [Curated Conversations](#curated-conversations)
- [Hackathons](#hackathons)
- [Ideation Popups](#ideation-popups)
- [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](#special-interest-groups-sigs)
- [Working Groups](#working-groups)


## Curated Conversations

Curated conversations are 1:1 or small-group dialogues that we help set up and sometimes facilitate.

### Purpose

We curate conversations when:

- Two or more people are working on similar or complementary problems.
- There’s potential for mutual learning or collaboration.
- A founder would benefit from talking with someone who has walked a similar path.

### Structure

- **Format:** can be 1:1 or small group
- **Privacy:** often off-the-record to support candid sharing
- **Role of AOS:** we broker the connection and, when appropriate, stay involved to support follow-up

Curated conversations are one of the quiet ways we add value. We don’t need credit; we care that useful connections are made.

## Hackathons

Hackathons are time-boxed sprints where people come together to build, test, and explore.

### Purpose

We use hackathons when:

- We want to energize a community around a theme.
- We want to test feasibility or surface new ideas quickly.
- We want to create a playful space for experimentation.

### Structure

- **Duration:** usually 1–3 days, sometimes async over a week
- **Participation:** open call with some curation for safety and fit
- **Output:** demoable prototypes, experiments, or patterns

### How We Run Hackathons

We try to:

- Make themes concrete but broad (e.g., “safer coordination tools for protests”).
- Encourage cross-pollination between designers, developers, researchers, organizers, and others.
- Support teams with mentors or office hours from the Studio Rolodex.
- Center safety, consent, and respect for lived experience.

Not every hackathon output becomes a Foundry project. That’s okay. The exploration is valuable on its own.

## Ideation Popups

Ideation popups are short, one-off sessions where we invite a small group to think together about a specific idea, challenge, or opportunity.

### Purpose

We use ideation popups when:

- Something is emerging and we want quick, multi-perspective input.
- A founder or team wants to pressure-test a concept.
- We want to generate options before committing to a direction.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 60–90 minutes
- **Participants:** curated mix of people with relevant experience and lived context
- **Output:** notes, themes, and potential next steps

An ideation popup might lead to:

- a better-shaped Foundry proposal,
- a Lab working group,
- or simply a clearer “not this, not now” decision.

## Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

Special interest groups are recurring gatherings of people who care about a particular domain (e.g., youth safety, decentralized identity, low-resource environments). Special interest groups exist for ongoing dialogue, exploration, and shared learning across a topic area. Their purpose is not to deliver a single artifact, but to create a space for people who are interested in a theme to connect, exchange knowledge, compare approaches, and experiment together over time. A SIG may eventually discover a goal worth pursuing and spin off a working group—but producing a deliverable is not the default expectation.

### Purpose

SIGs are for:

- ongoing peer exchange
- sharing evolving practices and research
- building relationships across projects and geographies

### Structure

- **Membership:** open to anyone aligned with the values of the group
- **Cadence:** regular, but flexible (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- **Format:** calls, async channels, or a mix

SIGs often surface questions or themes that later become working groups, hackathons, or Foundry projects.

## Working Groups

Working groups are small, focused circles that meet over time to explore a shared topic or challenge. Working groups come together around a specific, concrete goal. They are time-bound, purpose-driven, and oriented toward producing something—such as a position paper, a protocol draft, an interoperability standard, a reference implementation, or a decision-support guide. Once the deliverable is completed, the working group can disband, evolve, or spin off into something else.

### Purpose

We use working groups when:

- A question is too big for one meeting.
- There’s enough interest to sustain ongoing conversation.
- We want to move toward concrete insights, patterns, or prototypes.

### Structure

- **Size:** typically 4–10 people
- **Duration:** a few sessions over weeks or months
- **Format:** regular calls or async collaboration, depending on participants
- **Output:** could be notes, patterns, prototypes, or recommendations

### Starting a Working Group

Anyone in the ecosystem can propose a working group topic by:

- describing the question or challenge,
- naming who they think should be in the conversation,
- sharing what “progress” would look like.

We use these proposals to decide which groups we can support with facilitation, documentation, or infrastructure.
