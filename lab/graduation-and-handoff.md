# Graduation and Handoff

Lab explorations don't run forever. They end through completion, graduation to Foundry, or winding down.

## Completion

The question is answered. Outputs are produced. Everyone agrees "we've done what we set out to do."

## Graduation to Foundry

The exploration has matured into something that should become a real project.

**Signs it's ready:**
- Something concrete to build (not just research)
- Someone willing to lead it
- Enough clarity to execute
- Fits AOS's focus (freedom tech, open protocols)

**Process:**
1. Lab lead proposes graduation to AOS: what the project would be, who would lead it, why it's ready
2. AOS core evaluates fit, capacity, and readiness
3. If approved, normal Foundry onboarding begins (see [../foundry/how-projects-join.md](../foundry/how-projects-join.md))
4. Lab exploration formally closes: outputs documented, group thanked, Signal closed

## Wind-down

The exploration stalls, energy dies, or the question turns out less important than expected.

**This is not failure.** Learning that a question isn't worth pursuing is valuable.

When winding down: document what happened and what was learned, share learnings with the ecosystem, thank participants, close gracefully. The question might become relevant later.

## What Happens to Outputs

Useful outputs get published (blog posts, GitHub repos, NIPs) or integrated into existing projects. Things that aren't immediately useful get archived for future reference. Dead ends get documented as learning and discarded. Not everything needs preserving.

## Ongoing Explorations

Some topics are inherently ongoing - recurring coordination, monitoring an evolving space. These don't graduate or complete in the normal sense.

For ongoing work: set periodic review points, be willing to wind down if energy dies, rotate leadership to prevent burnout, keep scope tight.
