# Routing Guide: Foundry, Lab, and Studio

After triage and (if needed) a discovery session, we decide where to route a project, idea, or contributor within the AOS hubs.

We're not trying to "score" or "rank" people. We're trying to place them in a context where they can actually move forward.

## Quick Reference

| Hub | Best for | Commitment level |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| **Foundry** | Projects ready to build | High - ongoing partnership |
| **Lab** | Questions and exploration | Medium - convening participation |
| **Studio** | Contributors and services | Flexible - match as needed |

## When We Route to Foundry

We tend to route projects into the **Foundry** when:

- There is a clear or emerging founder or steward
- There's some traction, validation, or strong conviction
- The project fits our focus on permissionless tech, open protocols, and freedom-supporting tools
- We believe we can walk alongside the team in a meaningful way

Foundry is where we invest more ongoing attention into a project. See [../foundry/how-projects-join.md](../foundry/how-projects-join.md) for details.

### Foundry signals

- "I'm building X and need help with Y"
- Has shipped something (even a prototype)
- Clear sense of users/beneficiaries
- Founder is committed and accountable
- Aligns with AOS values and focus areas

## When We Route to Lab

We route topics or ideas into the **Lab** when:

- The core need is exploration, not execution
- The idea is still forming and would benefit from more perspectives
- The question is bigger than one project (e.g., "How do we design safer coordination tools for activists?")

Lab is where we convene working groups, hackathons, special interest groups, ideation popups, and curated conversations. See [../lab/](../lab/) for how that works.

### Lab signals

- "I'm curious about X but don't know where to start"
- "Has anyone solved Y before?"
- Research questions or thesis exploration
- Cross-cutting topics that affect multiple projects
- Early-stage ideas without clear ownership

## When We Route to Studio

We route people into the **Studio** when:

- They're offering skills, services, or deep expertise
- They want to support projects in product, research, design, management, or technical domains
- They want to be connected to aligned projects without necessarily joining a single team

Studio is our ecosystem Rolodex and service directory. See [../studio/](../studio/) for more.

### Studio signals

- "I can help with X"
- "I'm looking to contribute my Y skills"
- Experienced practitioners wanting to give back
- Service providers aligned with the ecosystem
- People between projects looking for their next thing

## Mixed Routing

Sometimes the answer is "all of the above":

- A founder might bring a project that belongs in the Foundry **and** want to join Lab conversations on related topics
- A contributor might join the Studio Rolodex **and** propose a Lab working group
- A Lab exploration might mature into a Foundry project

We encourage these overlaps. Our routing is flexible by design.

### Common combinations

| Primary | Secondary | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Foundry | Lab | Founder wants to learn from others working on similar problems |
| Foundry | Studio | Founder also wants to contribute skills to other projects |
| Lab | Studio | Researcher wants to be matched with projects needing their expertise |
| Studio | Lab | Contributor wants to help shape ecosystem direction |

## Saying "Not Now" or "Not Here"

There are times when we decide we're **not** the right place, at least for now. Common reasons:

- **Capacity:** We don't have bandwidth to support well right now
- **Fit:** The project or skills don't align with our focus areas
- **Timing:** Great idea, but too early or too late for us to add value
- **Safety:** Engaging could create risk we can't manage responsibly

When that happens, we try to:

- Be honest and kind about why (see [05-response-templates.md](./05-response-templates.md))
- Respect confidentiality and safety
- Point to adjacent communities or resources when we know them
- Leave the door open for future connection if appropriate

Our capacity is finite. Our commitment to treating people with respect is not.

## Routing Decision Checklist

Before finalizing routing, confirm:

- [ ] We understand what they're trying to do
- [ ] We've identified where they can get the most value
- [ ] We have capacity to support them in that context
- [ ] We've considered safety and privacy implications
- [ ] We have a clear next step to communicate

## After Routing

Once routing is decided:

1. **Communicate the decision** using appropriate template
2. **Make introductions** to relevant hub coordinator
3. **Create necessary records** (Rolodex entry, project file, etc.)
4. **Set expectations** for what comes next
5. **Document rationale** in intake tracker for future reference
