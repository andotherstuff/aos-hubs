# Privacy and Safety Guide

This guide covers how we handle submissions from people in sensitive contexts - activists, journalists, dissidents, and others who face real risks from their work.

## Core Principles

1. **Assume good faith** - Most people asking for privacy have good reasons
2. **Minimize data** - Collect only what's needed, store only what's necessary
3. **Default to caution** - When uncertain, err on the side of protecting people
4. **Respect autonomy** - Let people decide their own risk tolerance
5. **Be honest about limits** - We can't guarantee perfect security

## Recognizing High-Risk Contexts

Someone may be in a high-risk context if they:

- Work in or with people in authoritarian regions
- Do journalism or activism that could attract retaliation
- Work on tools for circumventing censorship or surveillance
- Explicitly mention safety or privacy concerns
- Use pseudonyms or anonymous contact methods
- Ask about our security practices

When in doubt, ask: "Are there any safety or privacy considerations we should be aware of?"

## Communication Security

### Secure channels

For high-risk communications, offer:

- **Signal** - Default recommendation for most cases
- **SimpleX** - For higher-risk situations (no phone number required)
- **Encrypted email** (PGP) - If they prefer, though more complex
- **Nostr DMs** - Acceptable if they're already in the ecosystem

Avoid for sensitive discussions:
- Unencrypted email
- Slack/Discord (even in DMs)
- SMS
- Regular phone calls

### Video calls

For discovery sessions with at-risk participants:

- Offer audio-only or text-based alternatives
- Don't require video if they're uncomfortable
- Use end-to-end encrypted platforms (Signal, Jitsi) over Zoom/Google Meet
- Don't record without explicit consent
- Consider timezone-appropriate scheduling to avoid unusual patterns

## Data Handling

### What we collect

**Minimum necessary:**
- Name or alias (their choice)
- One contact method
- Enough context to understand their needs

**Optional (only if offered):**
- Real name
- Location
- Organization affiliation
- Additional contact methods

### What we store

| Information type | Storage location | Access |
|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Basic intake info | Intake tracker | Intake team only |
| Detailed notes | Encrypted storage | Need-to-know basis |
| Sensitive details | Memory only / not stored | Individual reviewer |

### What we don't store

- Government IDs or official documents
- Precise locations for at-risk individuals
- Information they ask us not to retain
- Details that could identify sources or contacts

### Data retention

- Delete detailed notes after routing is complete
- Retain only what's needed for ongoing relationship
- Honor deletion requests promptly
- Regularly review what we're storing and why

## Pseudonymous Participation

We welcome pseudonymous participation. When someone uses a pseudonym:

**Do:**
- Use the name they give you consistently
- Respect that they may have good reasons
- Focus on their project/skills, not their identity
- Store their preferred name, not speculation about real identity

**Don't:**
- Ask why they're using a pseudonym
- Try to verify their "real" identity
- Share speculation about who they might be
- Require identity verification for participation

## Documentation Practices

### For high-risk projects/people

- Use aliases in shared documents
- Avoid specifics that could identify them
- Keep detailed notes in encrypted storage only
- Consider whether documentation is necessary at all
- Ask what level of visibility they're comfortable with

### Redaction guidelines

When documenting sensitive work:

- Replace names with consistent aliases
- Generalize locations ("Southeast Asia" not specific country)
- Remove identifying details from project descriptions
- Avoid dates/times that could correlate with events
- Strip metadata from any shared files

## Public vs. Private Information

### What goes public (process docs, this repo)

- How our processes work (generic)
- Criteria we use for decisions
- Types of support we offer

### What stays private

- Individual submissions and applications
- Discovery session notes
- Routing decisions and rationale
- Any information about specific people or projects

### What requires explicit consent

- Mentioning someone's involvement with AOS
- Listing them in any public directory
- Connecting them with others outside AOS
- Sharing their work or ideas externally

## Red Flags and Escalation

### Signs something may be wrong

- Requests for information about other participants
- Pressure to reveal identities or locations
- Attempts to join specifically to access certain people
- Inconsistent stories or suspicious patterns
- Claims that don't match observable reality

### What to do

1. Don't confront directly
2. Don't share concerns with the person
3. Discuss privately with another AOS team member
4. Document concerns in secure storage
5. Slow down the process while you assess
6. When in doubt, politely decline to proceed

## Incident Response

If you believe someone's safety has been compromised:

1. **Stop** - Don't take actions that could make it worse
2. **Assess** - What information may have been exposed?
3. **Notify** - Alert the affected person immediately (via secure channel)
4. **Document** - Record what happened for learning
5. **Review** - Identify how to prevent recurrence

## Self-Care for Reviewers

Working with people in difficult situations can be heavy. Remember:

- You're not responsible for solving their problems
- It's okay to set boundaries
- Talk to teammates if something affects you
- Take breaks when needed
- We can't help everyone, and that's okay
