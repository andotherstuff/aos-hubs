# Discovery Session Guide

For many projects and ideas, we schedule a short discovery session with the founder or core team. This helps us understand what they're trying to do and how we might support them.

## Purpose

We run discovery sessions to:

- Hear the founder's story in their own words
- Clarify goals and definitions of success
- Understand constraints, risks, and blockers
- Decide whether the best fit is Foundry, Lab, Studio, or some combination

It's a conversation, not an interview.

## Format Options

### Synchronous (preferred for most cases)

- **Duration:** 30-45 minutes
- **Participants:** 1-2 people from AOS and the founder(s)
- **Mode:** Video or audio call

### Asynchronous (for safety, timezone, or preference reasons)

- **Duration:** Equivalent exchange over 1-2 weeks
- **Mode:** Encrypted text (Signal, SimpleX, or similar)
- **Structure:** We send questions in batches, allow time for thoughtful responses

Use async when:
- The person is in a high-risk context where calls could be monitored
- Timezone differences make scheduling impractical
- The person explicitly prefers written communication
- Language barriers make real-time conversation difficult

## Core Questions

We anchor the session around three core questions:

### 1. What is your goal with this project or idea?

We listen for both the concrete goal (e.g., "ship an MVP") and the deeper intention (e.g., "help people coordinate during internet shutdowns").

*Follow-ups:*
- How did you come to this idea?
- What drew you to this problem?

### 2. What does success look like for you?

This includes both project outcomes (impact, users, deployments) and personal outcomes (learning, sustainability, reputation, safety).

*Follow-ups:*
- What would make this feel worthwhile even if the project doesn't take off?
- Are there outcomes you want to avoid?

### 3. What encouragement, help, and support do you need to overcome what's in the way?

We ask about barriers: technical, emotional, political, logistical, safety-related, or resource-related.

*Follow-ups:*
- What have you already tried?
- What's the biggest blocker right now?
- What kind of support would be most valuable?

## Additional Questions (as relevant)

- **Who is this for?** Who are the intended users or beneficiaries?
- **What have you already tried?** Previous approaches, lessons learned
- **How do you like to collaborate?** Async/sync preferences, tools, pace
- **What's your capacity?** Time, energy, competing commitments
- **Are there specific risks we should be aware of?** Safety, legal, reputational
- **What's your relationship to the broader ecosystem?** Existing connections, communities, conferences, cohorts
- **What's your current funding situation?** Grants, self-funded, looking for support, runway

## What We Capture

Internally, we document:

- A short summary (2-3 sentences)
- The founder's stated goals and success criteria
- The main obstacles they named
- Collaboration preferences and constraints
- Current funding situation
- Ecosystem connections
- Skillset and expertise
- Contact information
- Safety or privacy considerations
- Our initial thoughts on Foundry, Lab, or Studio fit
- Recommended next steps

We do **not** publish these notes publicly. The public docs you see here describe *how* we run the process, not what any individual shared with us.

## What Happens Next

After the call, we:

1. **Reflect** as an AOS team on where we can genuinely add value
2. **Propose a path:** Foundry, Lab, Studio, or a mix
3. **Communicate back** within 1 week with our recommendation and next steps
4. **Stay honest** if we aren't the right fit, and point to other resources when we can

## Tips for Running Discovery

**Do:**
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask follow-up questions to understand, not to challenge
- Take notes but stay present
- Be honest about what AOS can and can't offer
- Respect time boundaries

**Don't:**
- Turn it into a pitch evaluation
- Promise things you can't deliver
- Rush to categorize before understanding
- Share details with people outside the intake team
- Record without explicit consent
