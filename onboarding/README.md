# Onboarding

This directory explains how we handle inbound interest, how we triage projects and contributors, and how we run discovery sessions before routing people into the Foundry, Lab, or Studio.

We keep the *content* of applications private, but we publish the **process** so anyone can understand how we work.

## Typical timelines

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 1 week of submission
- **Triage decision**: 1-2 weeks after acknowledgment
- **Discovery session** (if needed): Scheduled within 2-3 weeks
- **Final routing decision**: Within 1 week of discovery

These are targets, not guarantees. We do our best to be responsive, but our capacity is limited.
