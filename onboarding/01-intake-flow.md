# Intake Flow

We keep our intake process as lightweight as possible. Most interest comes in through a simple form on our website.

## What We Ask For

At a minimum, we ask for:

- A name or alias
- A contact handle (email and/or Nostr)
- Whether you're reaching out as a **project/idea founder** or a **contributor/service provider**
- A short description of your project, idea, or skills
- What you hope to get out of connecting with AOS

Optionally, we may invite you to share:

- Links to relevant work (GitHub, website, portfolio)
- Your timezone
- Any safety or privacy considerations we should be aware of

We welcome pseudonyms and privacy-conscious participation, especially for people doing sensitive freedom or pro-democracy work.

## What Happens After You Submit

1. **Confirmation** – Your submission is logged in our internal systems.
2. **Initial review** – Someone from AOS reviews your responses and tags them as:
   - primarily a **project/idea**, or
   - primarily a **contributor/service provider**.
3. **Triage** – We apply the triage framework in [`02-triage-framework.md`](./02-triage-framework.md) to decide next steps.
4. **Discovery session (if needed)** – For projects/ideas, we often invite you to a short discovery call (see [`03-discovery-session-guide.md`](./03-discovery-session-guide.md)).
5. **Routing** – We route you and/or your project into the Foundry, Lab, Studio, or our broader ecosystem (see [`04-routing-guide.md`](./04-routing-guide.md)).

We do our best to respond in a timely way, but we won’t always be able to engage deeply with every request. Even when we can’t, we still want the process to feel respectful, transparent, and human.
