# Intake Flow

We keep our intake process as lightweight as possible. Most interest comes in through a simple form on our website.

## What We Ask For

At a minimum, we ask for:

- A name or alias
- A contact handle (email and/or Nostr)
- Whether you're **exploring support for a project or idea** or want to **contribute as a collaborator or service provider (Studio)**

Depending on your selection, we ask a few follow-up questions:

**If you're exploring support for a project or idea:**
- Project or idea (if applicable)
- What is your goal with this project or idea?
- What does success look like for you?
- What encouragement, help, or support do you need?

**If you want to contribute as a collaborator or service provider:**
- What skills or services do you offer?
- Relevant experience or examples (optional)
- Preferred ways to collaborate
- Availability

Optionally, we may invite you to share:

- Links to relevant work (GitHub, website, portfolio)
- Your timezone
- Any safety or privacy considerations we should be aware of

We welcome pseudonyms and privacy-conscious participation, especially for people doing sensitive freedom or pro-democracy work.

## What Happens After You Submit

1. **Confirmation** - Your submission is logged in our internal systems.
2. **Triage** - We apply the triage framework in [02-triage-framework.md](./02-triage-framework.md) to decide next steps.
3. **Discovery session (if needed)** - For projects/ideas, we often invite you to a short discovery call (see [03-discovery-session-guide.md](./03-discovery-session-guide.md)).
4. **Routing** - We route you and/or your project into the Foundry, Lab, Studio, or our broader ecosystem (see [04-routing-guide.md](./04-routing-guide.md)).

We do our best to respond in a timely way, but we won't always be able to engage deeply with every request. Even when we can't, we still want the process to feel respectful, transparent, and human.

## Estimated Timelines

|------|-----------|
| Acknowledgment of receipt | Within 1 week |
