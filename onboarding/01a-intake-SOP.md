# AOS Intake Response Standard Operating Procedure

This SOP describes the steps for reviewing and responding to new Expressions of Interest. It operationalizes the flow documented in [01-intake-flow.md](./01-intake-flow.md).

## Timeline Overview

| Step | Target Timeframe | Owner |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 1 week | Intake reviewer |
| Triage decision | 1-2 weeks after acknowledgment | Intake team |
| Discovery invitation | Within 1 week of triage | Intake reviewer |
| Discovery session | Within 2 weeks of invitation | AOS team member |
| Final routing | Within 1 week of discovery | Intake team |

## 1. Intake Monitoring

Check new Formspree submissions daily (or at minimum every 2-3 days).

Record each submission in the intake tracker, including:

- Name or alias
- Preferred contact method
- Submission type: Project/Idea or Contributor/Service Provider
- For projects: goal, success criteria, support needed
- For contributors: skills, experience, collaboration preferences, availability
- Safety or privacy notes
- Date received
- Status (New / Acknowledged / In Triage / Discovery Scheduled / Routed / Closed)

## 2. Initial Acknowledgment

**Timeline: Within 1 week of submission**

Send a brief acknowledgment (see internal templates):

- Thank them for reaching out
- Confirm receipt of their submission
- Reassure them that safety and privacy are respected
- Provide timeline for next steps (1-2 weeks for triage)

Update tracker status to "Acknowledged."

## 3. Triage

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks after acknowledgment**

Apply the framework in [02-triage-framework.md](./02-triage-framework.md) to determine initial routing:

### Project / Idea submissions
- Clear founder + defined goal → **Foundry** candidate, schedule Discovery
- Exploratory / early-stage → **Lab** candidate, consider convening invitation
- Unclear fit → Schedule Discovery to clarify

### Contributor / Service Provider submissions
- Clear skills + good values fit → **Studio**, add to Rolodex
- Wants project matching → **Studio**, flag for active matching
- Unclear fit → Brief follow-up call or async questions

### Edge cases
- Too vague → Request clarification or invite to Lab convening
- Out of scope → Polite decline with alternative suggestions
- High-risk context → Apply privacy protocols (see [05-privacy-safety-guide.md](./05-privacy-safety-guide.md))

## 4. Internal Review

Share submission with intake reviewers before finalizing triage:

- Validate proposed category
- Identify any follow-up needs or concerns
- Note safety, privacy, or anonymity considerations
- Confirm or adjust proposed next step

## 5. Discovery Session Invitation

**Timeline: Within 1 week of triage decision**

If Discovery is needed, send invitation (see internal templates).

Offer:
- Video/audio call (30-45 minutes)
- Text-based async option for those who prefer or need it

Provide 2-3 scheduling options or a scheduling link.

## 6. Discovery Session

**Timeline: Within 2 weeks of invitation**

Follow the guide in [03-discovery-session-guide.md](./03-discovery-session-guide.md).

Capture internally:
- Intent and desired outcomes
- Obstacles and support needs
- Preferred collaboration style
- Time/energy constraints
- Recommended fit: Foundry / Lab / Studio / combination

## 7. Final Routing Decision

**Timeline: Within 1 week of Discovery**

After Discovery (or after triage if no Discovery needed), assign one of the following:

| Routing | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Foundry** | Structured, MVP-oriented co-building |
| **Lab** | Exploratory work, research, working groups, SIGs |
| **Studio** | Service provider or contributor support |
| **Rolodex Only** | Contributor matched to future opportunities |
| **Hold for Later** | Promising but not time-sensitive |
| **Not a Fit** | Polite decline |

Document the decision and rationale in the tracker.

## 8. Follow-Up Communication

Send the appropriate template (see internal templates):

- Foundry welcome + next steps
- Lab invitation + upcoming convenings
- Studio/Rolodex confirmation + how matching works
- Hold acknowledgment + when to expect follow-up
- Not a fit + alternative suggestions (if any)

## 9. Handoff

For accepted submissions:

- **Foundry**: Create project entry, assign AOS point person, schedule kickoff
- **Lab**: Add to relevant convening list, notify Lab coordinator
- **Studio**: Create/update Rolodex entry, notify Studio coordinator

## 10. Archiving

- Mark intake as completed in tracker
- Store notes in appropriate location (public process docs vs. private submission details)
- Ensure any sensitive information is handled per [05-privacy-safety-guide.md](./05-privacy-safety-guide.md)

## Intake Tracker Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ID | Unique identifier |
| Date Received | Submission date |
| Name/Alias | How they identify |
