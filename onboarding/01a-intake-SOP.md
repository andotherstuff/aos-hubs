# AOS Intake Response SOP
_This SOP describes the steps for reviewing and responding to new Expressions of Interest.  
It operationalizes the flow documented in `/onboarding/01-intake-flow.md`._

---

## 1. Intake Monitoring
- Check new Formspree submissions daily.  
- Record each submission in the intake tracker, including:
  - Name or alias  
  - Preferred contact  
  - Role type(s)  
  - Project description (if any)  
  - Contributor/service-provider details (if any)  
  - Safety or privacy notes  
  - Date received  

---

## 2. Initial Acknowledgment
Send a brief acknowledgment within 1 week:
- Thank them for reaching out.  
- Confirm receipt of their submission.  
- Reassure them that safety and privacy are respected.  
- Provide a timeline for next steps (1-2 weeks).

---

## 3. Preliminary Categorization
Use form responses to determine the initial routing:

### Project / Idea
- Tentatively route to the **Foundry** or **Lab**.

### Contributor / Service Provider
- Tentatively route to the **Studio** and consider adding to the expert rolodex.

### Unsure / Mixed
- Requires a **Discovery Session** to clarify fit.

---

## 4. Internal Review
Share the submission with the intake reviewers:
- Validate category.  
- Identify any follow-up needs or concerns.  
- Note safety, privacy, or anonymity considerations.  

---

## 5. Discovery Session Invitation
If appropriate, invite the person to a 20–30 minute call (or async alternative).  
Discovery uses three core questions:

1. What is your goal?  
2. What does success look like?  
3. What support do you need?

---

## 6. Discovery Session
Capture:
- Intent, desired outcomes.  
- Felt obstacles and support needs.  
- Preferred collaboration style.  
- Time/energy constraints.  
- Fit with Foundry / Lab / Studio.  

---

## 7. Final Sorting
After Discovery, assign one of the following:

- **Foundry** — structured, MVP-oriented co-building.  
- **Lab** — exploratory, research, prototyping, working groups, SIGs.  
- **Studio** — service provider or contributor support.  
- **Rolodex Only** — contributor matched to future opportunities.  
- **Hold for Later** — promising but not time-sensitive.  
- **Not a Fit** — politely decline.

Document the decision in the tracker.

---

## 8. Follow-Up
Send the correct template:
- Foundry onboarding  
- Lab onboarding  
- Studio/rolodex  
- Observer/unsure  
- Not a fit  

---

## 9. Archiving
- Mark intake as completed.  
- Store notes in the appropriate hub directory (public or private as needed).
