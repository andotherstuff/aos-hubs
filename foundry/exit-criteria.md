# Exit Criteria for Foundry Projects

"Exit" doesn't mean "you're out." It means the project is in a different season.

## Graduation

A project has "graduated" when:

- It has a stable steward or team
- It has a clear direction and functioning roadmap
- It no longer needs regular, structured support from AOS

We may still stay in relationship as peers, feature the project in Lab convenings, or connect people through Studio.

## Pause

Sometimes projects need to pause. People's lives change, contexts shift, priorities move.

We mark a project as "paused" when:

- There has been no meaningful activity for a while
- The founder tells us they need to step back
- Continuing would create more pressure than progress

A pause is not a failure. It's an honest reflection of reality. Paused projects can resume when circumstances change.

## Transformation

Some projects evolve: the original idea morphs, two projects merge, or a piece spins out into its own tool.

When that happens, we decide with the founder(s) whether the new shape continues the existing relationship or makes more sense as a fresh project with new orientation.

## Wind-down

Sometimes a project needs to stop rather than pause. The idea didn't work, the founder can't continue, or circumstances make it impossible to proceed.

Wind-down is a formal process:

1. **Conversation** - AOS and the founder discuss what's happening and confirm wind-down is the right path
2. **Finalize open work** - Complete or hand off anything in progress; don't leave things half-done
3. **Notify contributors** - Anyone involved in the project should know it's ending
4. **Update documentation** - Mark repos, docs, and any public materials to reflect the project's status
5. **Transition contributors** - Studio contributors find their next project or move on from AOS

Wind-down is not failure in a shameful sense. It's an honest ending that respects everyone's time and contributions.
