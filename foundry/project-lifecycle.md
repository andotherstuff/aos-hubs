# Project Lifecycle in the Foundry

We think in seasons and cycles rather than rigid phases. Still, it helps to describe the typical lifecycle.

## 1. Orientation

- Get to know the founder(s) and the project
- Confirm alignment and safety considerations
- Agree on a short-term focus (e.g., "validate the core user need," "ship a v0.1 MVP")

## 2. Exploration and Framing

- Refine the problem statement and goals
- Identify core users or communities
- Consider risks and unintended consequences
- Map dependencies on protocols, infrastructure, and other actors

## 3. Building and Iterating

- The project builds, with support from AOS and Studio contributors as appropriate
- Studio provides access to designers, researchers, developers, and other specialists who can help with specific needs
- Small experiments and tight feedback loops
- Code, docs, and process co-evolve

## 4. Reflection and Adjustment

- Pause periodically to ask: what's working, what's not, what has changed?
- Adjust scope or direction based on learnings
- Revisit safety and governance questions as needed

## 5. Exit

Eventually, a project will graduate, pause, or transform. See [exit-criteria.md](./exit-criteria.md).

## Ongoing Rhythm

**Check-ins:** At least monthly, more frequent when needed. Usually via Signal chat or call.

**When things stall:** If a project loses momentum, the founder should notify AOS with what's happening and what might help. If AOS notices a project going quiet, we'll reach out to understand the situation and see what can be done. If it's not fixable, we move to wind-down (see [exit-criteria.md](./exit-criteria.md)).

The goal is honest communication in both directions. Problems caught early are easier to address.
