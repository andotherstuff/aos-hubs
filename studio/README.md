# Studio

The Studio is our ecosystem Rolodex and services hub - roughly 20 contributors who can help projects with product, design, operations, and technical work.

Some are part of AOS. Many are not. What they share is a commitment to open, permissionless ecosystems and the communities those systems serve.

We design the Studio to respect privacy and safety. Not everyone wants or can afford to be fully visible, especially in high-risk contexts.
