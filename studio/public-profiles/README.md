# Public Profiles

This directory is for contributors who choose to have a public-facing profile in the Studio.

Each profile should:

- Follow the structure in [contributor-profile-template.md](../contributor-profile-template.md)
- Respect the contributor's own safety and privacy boundaries
- Avoid revealing sensitive affiliations without consent

To add, update, or remove your profile, open an issue or contact an AOS steward through [andotherstuff.org](https://andotherstuff.org).
