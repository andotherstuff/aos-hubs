# Studio Directory Structure

We maintain a partially public structure so people can understand what expertise exists without forcing every contributor to expose their identity.

## Public vs Private

**Public:**
- Directory structure and role types
- [Contributor profile template](./contributor-profile-template.md)
- [Public profiles](./public-profiles/) for contributors who choose visibility

**Private:**
- Sensitive contact details
- Legal names (if different from public handles)
- Information that could increase risk for someone doing sensitive work

## Pseudonyms and Partial Profiles

We welcome:

- Pseudonymous contributors
- Role-only listings (e.g., "senior cryptography reviewer in EU timezone")
- Profiles with a Nostr or GitHub handle but no legal name

The goal is to make collaboration easier without increasing anyone's exposure to risk.
