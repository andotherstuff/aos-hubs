# Contributing to AOS Hubs

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the **AOS Hubs** documentation.  
We build in the open and welcome contributions from founders, researchers, designers, developers, organizers, and anyone working in the permissionless tech ecosystem.

This repository documents *how* AOS onboards projects, convenes people, and supports builders. Contributions should follow the hybrid tone of AOS — clear, human, and community-oriented.

- proposing new convening formats  
- refining onboarding flows  
- adding or updating your public contributor profile  
- suggesting improvements to the Foundry, Lab, or Studio processes  
- filing issues for unclear, outdated, or ambiguous content  

We value contributions that increase safety, clarity, and usability for real people operating in real-world, sometimes high-risk contexts.
